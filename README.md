# Rectangle-Test
Code that failed to get me a job.
I was assigned a coding project from a prospective employer. This is what I created. My program met the requirements -- generate two rectangles and determine their relative positions -- but my code was deemed insufficient. It's a good demonstration of my current skill level, i.e., entry level. I haven't yet mastered advanced techniques. The project was created in C# using Visual Studio.
