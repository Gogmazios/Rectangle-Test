# Rectangle-Test
Code that failed to get me a job.
I was assigned a coding project from a prospective employer. This is what I created. My program met the requirements -- generating two rectangles and determining their relative positions -- but my code was deemed insufficient ("not horrible"; lol). It's a good demonstration of my current skill level, i.e., I understand the basics but haven't yet mastered advanced techniques. The project was created in C# using Visual Studio.
